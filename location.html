            The Grand Velas is located on a gorgeous white-sand beach off the Cancun - Chetumal road that runs along the Riviera Maya coast. There is nothing within walking distance aside from a handful of resorts, but a 15-minute cab ride gets you to dining, shopping,
            and nightlife in Playa del Carmen. It used to be the home of the ancient Mayans, and after that a small fishing village, but now Playa del Carmen -- or "Playa," as the locals call it -- is full of exciting nightclubs, popular restaurants,
            cute boutiques, and resort hotels that sit on lovely white-sand beaches. Because many of the businesses are European-run, the rest of the town retains a hint of European flair. The main tourist thoroughfare of Playa is the cobblestone-lined,
            pedestrian street Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue), but there are plenty of fun outdoor activities for visitors, too, such as snorkeling, scuba diving, kayaking, and sailing. The offshore reef is part of the second largest reef system in the
            world, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.</p>
